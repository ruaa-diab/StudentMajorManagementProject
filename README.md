# StudentMajorManagementProject


Description
This project is designed to manage student data associated with various majors. It aims to provide a way to store, update, and display student records organized by their major.

Features
Manages a list of majors and their associated students.
Allows adding, updating, and deleting student records.
Displays student records by their respective majors.
Challenges Faced
During development, I initially used two separate lists for majors and students. This caused issues when trying to associate students with their respective majors. The logic for organizing the data didnâ€™t work as expected, and I had to adjust the structure.

Future Improvements
Refactor the code to ensure each major has its own list of students.
Add better error handling for user inputs.
Implement a more user-friendly interface for displaying student records.
Technologies Used
Java (or whatever language you used)
